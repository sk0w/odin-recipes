    <h1>Shakshuka</h1>

    <p>Shakshuka is maybe our favorite way to cook eggs. Partially because it is absolutely delicious, but also because it is really easy to scale up and cook for a crowd, like in this version that is baked in a casserole dish with 8 eggs.

        Shakshuka most commonly appears as eggs that are cracked into a freshly made, slighlty spicy, tomato sauce. The eggs then cook and are served in the sauce. It is claimed by many cultures and its origins though the general consensus is that it was created by Arabic people in the northwest of Africa.
        
        Now while you could simply use a great jar of tomato sauce (which we definitely do on busy weeknights), we find the that this sauce made with harissa and bell pepper, makes for a more substantial and flavorful base.
        
        Though you could serve this for breakfast, brunch, lunch or dinner, the only thing requirement is that you serve it along with some warm bread or pita to sop up all the runny egg yolk and spicy sauce.</p>
