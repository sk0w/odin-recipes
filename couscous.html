    <h1>How to cook couscous</h1>
    <img src="../couscousjpg" alt="couscous">
    <p>Bob’s Red Mill Golden Couscous is made from semolina flour. Essentially, it’s little ball-shaped pasta that’s delicious in everything from salads to sauces. It’s a traditional North African pasta that can be enjoyed as a side dish or breakfast cereal. 

        Cooking couscous is easy, especially once you nail the couscous water ratio! You’ll need 1 ¼ cups water or broth per 1 cup of Golden Couscous. After you bring your water or broth to a boil with a ½ teaspoon of salt, add your couscous. To give it a smoother texture, add in butter or oil with the couscous. Stir, cover, and let stand for 5 minutes once you remove it from the heat.
        
        You can also enjoy couscous as a cereal. Similar to the couscous water ratio, but slightly different, you’ll add 1 cup couscous to 2 cups hot milk and 2 tablespoons butter. Serve your breakfast cereal with maple syrup or honey for a bit of sweetness alongside toppings like nuts and fruit. 
        
        If you’re looking to try couscous as a salad, whip up a big bowl of this delicious Fresh Cherry & Pepita Golden Couscous Salad. The recipe comes to Bob’s Red Mill courtesy of Elisha Joyce from Rebel Grain and is both fresh and super easy to toss together. It makes for the perfect accompaniment to grilled meats or hearty veggies, but can also be served as a main dish. You can also experiment with this simple and scrumptious Moroccan Couscous, which is a snap to make and incorporates a variety of tasty spices. If you are looking for a dish that’s a little more heartier, try this Couscous Salad with Walnuts and Feta Cheese. With a dressing of oil, vinegar, garlic and feta, this salad is fit for gatherings of any kind. Throw it together, impress your guests, then enjoy the leftovers as lunch the following afternoon!
