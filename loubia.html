    <h1>how to make loubia</h1>
    <img src="../loubia.jpg" alt="loubia">
    <p>Well, it's been abnormally warm for November here in Algeria, buuuuut the weather report says it will rain heavily last in the next few days. And for those sadly and literally stuck in Snowmageddon it's time to break out the large stock pot or slow cooker. And make some bone warming dishes for our loved ones come home to. Loubia b'lham is one such Algerian dish. You would remember this dish Loubia b'dersa a few years back. Today, we'll be revisiting this traditional Algerian dish with white beans .... but this another even more flavorsome version with meat.</p>
    <p>Loubia b'lham, also called Tadjine d'haricot blanc, Tadjine Loubia, Loubia Algérienne, Loubia en sauce, cassoulet Algérienne or amicably just known as "Loubia". It's a slow-cooked Algerian specialty dish with white beans and lamb. Loubia b'lham could be considered the Algerian version of the French cassoulet.  The stew gets its flavor from dersa, a paste made from blend of ground dried  spicy red chilies and fresh red peppers. Dersa is similar to harissa, a spicy red pepper paste but isn't flavored with garlic, olive oil or any spices. But it has a deep rich earthy texture and taste. It's predominantly used in the eastern Algeria and in such dishes as Chtit'ha and eastern Algerian style couscous. You can easily make your own dersa by simply blanching a ripe red bell pepper to remove the skin, than pureeing the pepper and season by adding salt, little bit of olive oil. Or even simplier take a 1 whole jarred (roasted red pepper) and puree.</p>
    <p>Traditionally, this stew is served in a cassole with a splash of olive vinegar and drizzling of local extra virgin olive oil is added at the table to counter balance the richness of this dish. And of course tons of bread. This dish is simple, economical and easily made with everyday pantry ingredients. It is especially good for cold winter days and easy enough to leave it simmering unattended on the stove top.
        
        Today, I am presenting the method I learned from my late mother-n-law (Allah yarhama) using the favored flavoring of the north around Algiers lamb, carrots and fresh thyme. It uses a very modest of meat, only there for flavoring the dish so it's quite economical. I often just use bones in this dish. Other regions, have slight variations on this dish using chicken, beef, merguez, sheep feet or even khilli, which is an algerian preserved meat (kinda like jerky). You can easily subsitute lamb for beef here if you like. Even using wild game or bison would be killer in this dish I think!
        
        
        This is an easy and very tasty dish to prepare. Towards the end of cooking, I like to add a green pepper that will bring more taste to the sauce.</p>

    <b><i> let's get started with the recipe...</i></b>
    <h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>500g - 1lb soaked and rinsed beans</li>
        <li>3-4 TBS olive oil</li>
        <li>1 large onion, diced fine or grated</li>
        <li>2 large carrots, sliced or diced into bite-size chunks</li>
        <li> 3 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
        <li>300g - 3 ½ oz inexpensive cut of lamb (like scrag or arm shoulder chop)</li>
        <li>1 TBS tomato paste</li>
        <li>2 tsp sweet paprika</li>
        <li>1 tsp ground cumin</li>
        <li>½ tsp black pepper (or to taste)
            1 TBS dersa (or red pepper paste)۞
            harissa or cayenne pepper (optional, to taste)</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>few sprigs of fresh thyme OR 1 tsp dried thyme </li>
        <li>about 8 cups -2 liters chicken broth or water</li>
        <li>2 tsp salt (or to taste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>METHOD </h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the beans for least 12 hours or overnight in water with the baking soda. Or alternatively, use one of the methods described here. Drain the soaked beans and rinse well.</li>
        <li>Using a Dutch oven brown the meat in the olive oil on a medium fire. Remove and set aside. Add in the onion to sauté until transparent.</li>
        <li>Pushing the onions to the edges creating an open space in the middle. Add in the tomato paste and allow to caramelize on its own in the oil, about 5-6 minutes. This will take off the raw taste of the tomato paste and also impart a caramelized Earthy taste to the dish.</li>
        <li>Add back the meat, dersa, harissa (or cayenne), garlic, carrots, and stir. And then also add in the spices, bay leaves, thyme and enough broth or water to cover the beans + about 3 in - 8 cm. A quick and easy way to measure how much water you need is by adding enough water to the pot that you have about 3 fingers width of water above the beans.</li>
        <li>Add the pot partially with the lid and simmer on a low fire for about 40 - 45 minutes until the lamb is fork tender. Remove the bay leaves and thyme sprigs. Add the salt and stir well. Let cook for additional 5 minutes, then check the seasoning. Adjust if needed. Once the beans are cooked through, the dish will slightly thicken from the released starch of the beans but it shouldn't be mushy.</li>

    </ol>
    <h4>TO SERVE</h4>
        <p>This dish is traditionally served hot with vinegar made from olives, extra virgin olive oil and lots of freshly baked homemade bread on the side. It's also really nice with some H'miss pepper salad on the side. White vinegar or any other flavored vinegar (except apple cider) is fine. The vinegar cuts the rich heaviness of the beans. In my husband's familyBeghrir is always served after the meal.</p>
